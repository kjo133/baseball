        <h1>Adventures to Boston</h1>
        <p>One of the highlights of our senior year at Virginia Tech was taking a spontanious trip to Boston to see the Nationals
            play the Red Sox. It was an epic trip involving planes, trains, cars, and walking many miles. </p>
        <h3>Drive to Washington</h3>
        <p> We left Blacksburg, VA around 10:00pm on Tuesday night. Drove up and arrived to Washington DC around 2:00am on Wednesday.
            Unfortunately we didn't realize that the airport does not open until 4:30, so we had to kill a couple hours trying
            to sleep in the uncomfortable chairs.</p>
        <h3>Arriving in Boston</h3>
        <p>Our 6:30am flight to Boston departed on time. Fell asleep pretty much right after take off. The flight was supposed
            to be an hour and a half, but we arrived in just over an hour. Took the T from Logan to the Backbay area</p>
        <h3>Exploring Boston</h3>
        <p>The baseball game didn't start until 1:37 so we had a good amount of time to explore Boston. Got some much needed
            coffee and then went walking all around the city. Ended up by the harbor exploring areas along the way. From
            the harbor we decided to walk the 4.5 miles to Fenway. Long walk, but got to see the city and made a few more
            coffee stops along the way. After getting to Lansdowne Street we got a quick meal at Loretta's Last Call outside
            the park.</p>

        <h3>Washington Nationals vs Boston Red Sox</h3>
        <p>Walking up the stairs to the bleachers at Fenway was an incredible sight. Huge sense of accomplishment that after
            a long night and morning of traveling that we finally arrived at our goal. Chuckled at the fact that while we
            were up in Boston, the rest of our classmates were sitting in lecture. Our first seats were in the Center Field
            bleachers. Was cool to be close to the Green Monster. </p>

        <p>After a few innings we wanted to explore the park more. So we went and got some Fenway Franks and a couple beers
            and wandered around. Found some seats in RF where we stayed for a bit. Then moved to the first base line before
            moving all the way down just four rows from home plate. The Nationals won the game, but we felt we were the real
            winners for making it up to Boston all the way from Blacksburg.</p>

        <h3>Back to Blacksburg</h3>
        <p>After the game we got some dinner and then headed back to Backbay where we caught an overnight train back to Union
            Station in DC. Once arriving we had to take the DC Metro back to the airport where we left the car. Once we got
            the car we drove back to Blacksburg and arrived just in time to make the afternoon classes... which I skipped
            and went to bed. </p>
