        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Nationals Park</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">I have been a Natioanls fan since they arrived to Washington in 2005.  Nationals Park has been the stadium I have been to the most.  Have seen some historic games including the first Nationals no-hitter thrown by Jordan Zimmerman, Max Scherzer's 20 strikeout game, as well as a number of walk off wins. </p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">RFK Stadium</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">First home to the Nationals when they came back to Washington DC.  I was at opening night in 2005.  Very old stadium, but I have so many memories of my family and I going to games on Sunday afternoons.  I was also at the game where Nook Logan's poor base running ended the game against the Indians and I'm still bitter about how stupid he could be there.  We did get free hats though before the game.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Oriole Park at Camden Yards</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Before the Nationals came to DC I would go to Baltimore to watch the Orioles play with my dad.  I would go to a game or two every year up til 2005.  Beautiful park and was where I got my first baseball during batting practice against the Angels.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Traveled to Philly for the day to see the Nats play the Phillies.  Awesome time exploring the area and getting Cheesesteaks at Pat's and Geno's.  XFinity Live is a great place to pregame, and the ballpark has a number of bars where you can grab a beer and still see the game.  Thanks to Susie Hoopes for buying tickets for my birthday!</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">
          Took a trip to Toronto to see the Redsox vs Bluejays game.  The day started off a bit raining, but by gametime the sun was out.  We got to see the roof open up which was neat.  Cool atmosphere with passionate fans.  Ballpark is a bit old, but still has an awesome bar and standing room out in straight away center field.

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Fenway Park</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Been to Fenway Park a few times.  Most notible was when my friend and I traveled up from Blackburg, VA to see the Nationals play the Redsox for the day.  Drove up to DC, flew to Boston, watched the game, took the train back to DC, took the metro to the airport, drove back to Blacksburg in time to make the afternoon classes.  Classic ballpark with great restaurants outside the stadium.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Busch Stadium</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Summer of 2017, I made my way to Saint Louis to see the Nationals play the Cardinals.  The park is very nice and the skyline with the arc in the distance is a very cool sight to see.  Fans are very passionate about their team and treated us very nicely despite rooting for the opposing team.  Not many places to explore in the stadium and still see the game unfortunately.  They do have amazing doughnuts though.  </p>
